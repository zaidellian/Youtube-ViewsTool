- Free Proxy
- Try not to use free proxies. But if you have a paid subscription and you want to use authenticated IP feature, then you can use the free proxy category. Provide your text file path (where you saved the proxies) when the script asks for a proxy file name or a proxy - - - API. N.B: Available for http(s)/socks4/socks5

- Premium Proxy
- Proxies with authentication can also be done. To do so put your proxies in this format username:password@ipaddress:portor ipaddress:port:username:password in a text file. Every single line will contain a single proxy. Provide your text file path when the script asks - for a proxy file name or a proxy API.

N.B: Only available for http type proxy.

Rotating Proxy
You can also use the rotating proxies service. You can either authenticate your IP on your proxy provider service and use ipaddress:port as Main Gateway. N.B: Available for http(s)/socks4/socks5

Or direct use username:password combo like this username:password@ipaddress:port or ipaddress:port:username:password as Main Gateway.

N.B: Only available for http type proxy. You can use proxy API too.

Search Program can search youtube with the keyword you want and find the video with video title or video id. To do this you need to know what keyword can find your video on youtube search engine. Also you need to provide exact video title or video id. Put keyword and title like this format keyword :::: video title or keyword :::: video id in search.txt. Always use multiple keyword for the same video title or video id.

If you don't know any keyword just put your video title :::: video title or video title :::: video id in search.txt

Live Stream
This script supports live streams too. Just use this script as you would for the already uploaded video. Script will automatically know if your video is live. Just bear in mind, you need a high-end pc for higher threads to get more viewers. Basically, script will check every 60 secs if youtube shows x watching now is present. If your live stream ends, script will check 5 times to be sure. In another word, after your live stream ends, script takes 5 minutes to close the driver.

If you have never used this script before, use this first for an already uploaded video. This way, you will have a better understanding of how this script works. To do so, keep reading.

YouTube Music
Can generate views on YouTube Music too. In urls.txt put your music link like this https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxx. Script will automatically load YouTube Music when it sees link have music.youtube.com. Search feature is not available for this. So you need to empty the search.txt otherwise it will start searching videos in default YouTube.
